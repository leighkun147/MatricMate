        "options": ["2", "6", "5", "9"],
        "correctOptionIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "To solve for x, add 7 to both sides: 3x = 18. Then divide by 3: x = 6."
      },

        "id": "q2",
        "text": "What is the slope of the line represented by the equation y = 2x + 5?",
        "options": ["2", "5", "1/2", "-5"],
        "correctOptionIndex": 0,
        "explanation": "The slope of a line in the form y = mx + b is m, so the slope is 2."

        "options": ["16π", "8π", "12π", "32π"],
        "correctOptionIndex": 0,
        "explanation": "The area of a circle is given by A = πr^2. With r = 4, A = π(4)^2 = 16π."

        "correctOptionIndex": 0,
        "explanation": "Factor x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2). Setting each factor to 0 gives x = 2 and x = -2."
